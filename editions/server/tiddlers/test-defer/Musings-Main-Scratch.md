Yeah. Main musing tiddler ig ? Will be using markdown.

Hmmm.



Gosh, I want to do something productive, but WORK IS NOT INTRESTINGGGGG. I want to draw-ish ? At least learn/do something *else*.


Mini inquiétude sur Christophe "lol je dois te parlé en PV AEL". Mais probablement rien mdr. -- OK ouais c'était a ce propos mdr. "tu veux changer de mission??" - ouais, envie de faire du dev, ahah. Tkt.

Musique sur le téléphone en utilisant scrcpy, works well enough. Still frustrated by work. Lack thereof.

(2024-05-02, btw)

Kinda feel like I have no drive for anything. It's *very* annoying. It tastes like depression, kinda. I have plenty of things I *could* be doing, but am not. I want to have the drive to do something. Something else than wasting time, I mean. It really does feel like I'm wasting time rn. Writing my little letters to keep my little brain sane. Issue is, I'm not sure what's the root cause for that. Work? Task not adapted? 
I want to blame work, but I'm not sure that's the right thing to blame. I have a somewhat hard time recalling *when* was the last time I truely felt like a day at work was well spent and fulfilling.
I realize I've spent a year at Alstom and don't have much to show for it. Time at work feels like a blur.

I don't _hate_ my work, but I'm not liking it either. I don't like what I do and do not do.

Thing is, I'm not sure what I _want_. MyEm was mostly about coding, and I didn't do well there, ish. Though there were other issues at play there. 

I feel like there are blockages I do not know how to overcome. Increased oversight makes me nauseous, but lack of oversight makes me... not do anything.

I'm unsure what I _want_ to do. What's my ideal setup, what would be the ideal daily occupation for me. For the longest of times, what I wanted was "pays good enough to maintain my lifestyle, gives me enough free time for my hobbies".

Now, assumes I get the same pay, no strings attached. What do ? Unsure. Give time to local community, I think. Read. Finish my gaming backlog. Create shit, minifigures, tabletopRPG, stories, drawings, code. Maybe get involved properly into a FOSS project I care about.
 -- None of this is a proper job, tho. Something I could get payed to do. I think ?

This... is basically what my mother is doing with her retirement: chat, craft, watch funny shit, go meet friends, read, spend time with family

I feel like... the abnormals of Brave New World. Goddamn do I like the memories I have of it. So, am re-listening/reading it. Hmm.
